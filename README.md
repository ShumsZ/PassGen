# Password Generators
It is common knowledge for most these days that a strong password is necessary for security online.

A strong password consists of:

•	A combination of numbers, letters and special characters
•	A random ordering of characters (i.e. no consecutive letters or numbers)
•	Definitely no common phrases or words (like ‘password’…)
•	At least 16 characters 
[This reddit user](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/ifral7/oc_time_it_takes_to_crack_a_password_updated/) shared a great visual that describes perfectly what a strong password means:

With that in mind, and as an introduction to some fundamentals of Python, I decided to implement a password generator as my first ever pet project.
I have made 2 password generators:
- v1.0 – provides the user with a 16 digit password that is guaranteed to be a random assortment of letters, capital letters, numbers and special characters
- v2.0 – provides a password based on the user input of how many digits they would like the password to be set for. It gives the user a warning if the password is less than 8 digits.
